# recipess

This was mini project for coding dojo to make a small webpage about recipes with chicken and other such foods. I used validations with bootstrap and multiple webpages
with the ID of that user able to make their own recipes. I also made it so they can only edit and delete their own recipes. I used SQL for my database which you can see in my files.
I need to readd the config which I accidently deleted from the github.
